DecisionMaker
=============

Decision Maker game that lets user input items, whether they are a PRO or a CON, and give them a weight. Program adds up all the weighted PROs and CONs, and spits out the decision. Note the program currently only allows for two items to be entered, but this can be changed to as many items as needed.

Compile all java files in the repo and run DecisionDemo from cli to start the program.
